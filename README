In the lack of a better name, this game shall be called simply "c".
c is my entry to the Ludum Dare 20 compo.

It is short, it is a bit buggy. I just didn't have enough time to finish it well.
Code is ugly, builded on hacks and not documented. You've been warned.

Dependencies are:
On linux: libncurses
On windows(using mingw): libpdcurses
